        Anna, can you pull the item from the credit 
        section but add in a Labor line for $325.00.
        Thanks

        When Chuck ***** created SEMS 13081, it 
        was thought that the complaint replacement tile 
        was going to be all that was needed.  So, this 
        was entered with $0 to credit.  However, now 
        there's a small labor bill, too.
        Can this be fixed so that it will route to Sandy 
        when Sales completes approvals?
        Thanks,

        Subject: PO approval - *****
        Andrea,
        I would like Jerry's PO approval removed.  In the 
        end, I would like the PO approval setup to look 
        like the attached (proposal side).  Please confirm 
        that I should be making this request of you.
         << File: PO Approval Matrix.xls >>  
        Also, the plant says that it cannot use approval 
        route codes VEGAS09 and VEGAS10, and I 
        would like to find out if they are inactive or 
        something.  Any idea who I should direct this 
        request to?
