This software contains 2 applications, the client and the server.

The Client can be configured to search for specific error screens using the window title (case sensative)
or the window text or partial text.

It uses an ini file called winClient.ini

[General]
server=bay6server
portNo=8000
useIP=0
IPAddress=

Server= can be IP address of the server you wish to connect to or Name on local network
portNo= must mach the open port on the receiving server, default is 8000
useIP=1 only if you wish to send your IP to the server for connection, 
this will need to be used if not on local network
If useIP is not used then Computer name is sent to server for local name resolution.
IPAddress is the address you would use to connect back to this machine if UseIP=1, 
note if behind a router it will be the router address and port number that radmin is 
set up to use i.e. 192.35.129.27:4899 You would need to be sure that port forwarding is set up correctly.
If using a firewall then this application will require out bound access.
If using the Radmin remote access software then this will require access too.

Window titles are entered as 1=Windowname|part of window text, Note the pipe | between title and text!
you can use either window name or part of text on screen or both Window titles are case sensative.
The default settings in the ini file are set to trap all error messages generated by an FMPC.

The Server can be configured to use Radmin remote access software to connect back 
to the machine with the error message on.
This requires the installation of Radmin (www.radmin.com) on both the server and the client PC.
Details of configuration for radmin can be read in the radmin help file, if the Client or Server are 
behind routers/firewalls then port forwarding will need to be set up for both the client/server and radmin.
If using a firewall then this application will require in bound access.
If using the Radmin remote access software then this will require access too.
The server config is in the file winServer.ini

[General]

RadminPath=C:\Program Files\Radmin\
HiColour=1
UseNetCardNo=1
MsgTimeOut=120

portNo must mach the sending port on the client(s) machine
RadminPath is the path to radmin.exe folder installed seperately, if this can not be found 
the option for remote connection will not show and only the error text pluss an OK button
hicolour is for full colour remote access screen, use hicolour=1 for full colour and hicolour=0 for 16 colours
UseNetCardNo=1 for the First network card 2 for the Second 3 for the Third and 4 for the Fourth
MsgTimeOut=120 would allow the message to appear for 120 seconds, if the user does not click a button then the
