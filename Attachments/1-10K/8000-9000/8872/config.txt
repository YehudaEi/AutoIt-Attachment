;
;Hello there! Here's the deal:
;
;	The first section must be called "groups". Put your software-profiled groups 
;	in this section, like this: 
;		
;			[Groups]
;			group1 = Call Center
;			group2 = Finance
;			group3 = Auditing
;			group4 = Operations
;
;
;
;	
;	All of the other sections represent the individual programs and scripts you'll
;	be running from the Software Loader. Each section needs a "location" and "type".
;	It can also have groups. They look like:
;
;			[Qfiniti Agent Monitor]
;			Location=\\129.1.1.89\Installs\Qfiniti.bat
;			Type=Unmanaged
;			Call Center=yes
;
;
;		"Location" is where the script or program is located. Make sure it's
;		an unattended installation! Otherwise this whole thing is pretty pointless.
;
;		"Type" tells the Software Loader which section to put the checkbox in. This
;		has no other purpose but to keep things seperated and easy to read, and to
;		remind you not to go around installing License-Managed software willy-nilly.
;
;		Groups are added to each section to say that the program should be installed
;		by default for each member of that particular group. For example, Qfiniti Agent
;		Monitor should be installed by default on Call Center PCs, so an entry is added
;		that says " Call Center = yes ". Now when the "Call Center" radio button is
;		selected, this program will be automatically checked. You can make a program
;		part of many different groups, or even no groups, if desired.
