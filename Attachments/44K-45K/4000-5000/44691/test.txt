Shares have underperformed the broader averages over the prior three months, with a loss of over 6% in the period. At current price of $39.52, the stock is in the middle of its range for the period, which has a low at the $35 area and a high at $43. Those two boundaries are likely to be the levels tested on either a negative or positive surprise, respectively. A move down to $35 would end the current uptrend recovery from lows set in mid-June, which would have bearish implications for future price. A move to $43 while very short-term bullish would leave the stock in a neutral posture on a longer term basis near the 52-week high at $44.24. :theflyonthewall.com

The size of the 2-year was shaved by $1 B to $29 B and though the wi trades at 0.535%, which would be the cheapest stop in several years, Fed tightening prospects may leave traders sidelined.

theflyonthewall.com: 	Pandora tumbles after guidance miss but analysts remain upbeat
Shares of music streaming company Pandora (P) are falling after the company reported a slightly higher than expected second quarter profit and in-line revenue, but the midpoint of its third quarter profit guidance came in below analysts' consensus estimate. A number of analysts recommended buying the stock on its weakness today. WHAT'S NEW: Pandora reported second quarter earnings per share of 4c, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of 3c. The company's revenue was in-line with expectations and its total listening hours rose 29% year-over-year. However, the music streaming company provided Q3 EPS guidance of 5c-8c, versus analysts' consensus outlook of 8c. Pandora, however, raised its full-year EPS guidance to 16c-19c from 14c-18c, versus the consensus outlook of 17c. ANALYST REACTION: In a note to investors, Piper Jaffray analyst James Marsh recommended that investors buy Pandora on weakness today. The company is very much on track, as it posted solid listener growth and its monetization is quickly improving, Marsh stated. Pacific Crest analyst Corey Barrett also recommended that investors buy Pandora today. The company's advertising sales per sales employee has risen in each of the past two quarters, versus the same period a year earlier, the analyst wrote. As a result, Barrett is confident that the company can increase its monetization sufficiently to meet its updated 2014 guidance. Barrett kept a $45 price target and Outperform rating on the shares. PRICE ACTION: In mid-afternoon trading, Pandora sank $3.50, or 12%, to $25. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Einhorn bought Lam Research shares, sold Rite Aid last quarter
Well-known investor David Einhorn said his hedge fund, Greenlight Capital, had taken a new long position last quarter in Lam Research (LRCX), which develops equipment for semiconductor companies. Also last quarter, Greenlight sold out of its position in Rite Aid (RAD), Einhorn revealed. WHAT'S NEW: Greenlight made a "medium-sized" new investment in Lam Research, Einhorn revealed in his quarterly letter to investors. As the size of transistors shrink, chip makers must run each layer of chips through the manufacturing line multiple times until they work properly, the investor stated. Consequently, the chip makers must buy more of Lam's tools for each manufacturing line, Einhorn explained. The valuations of many high momentum stocks in the tech sector are excessive, but not all tech stocks are too expensive, Einhorn contended. A number of tech stocks - including Apple (AAPL), Lam Research, Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Micron Technology (MU) - "have strong prospects and are undervalued," Einhorn declared. Greenlight holds long positions in all those stocks. Greenlight sold its position in Rite Aid because the company's sales and profits rose, as the hedge fund had expected, and the stock reached fair value, Einhorn explained. WHAT'S NOTABLE: Greenlight continues to be short Questcor (QCOR), which has "a laundry list of problems and risks," the investor said. Among these are ongoing criminal probes and a large number of adverse events, including deaths, experienced by a number of patients who were taking the company's only drug, Acthar, Einhorn wrote. Additionally, a number of insurers have moved towards limiting their reimbursement of the drug, he added. The FDA is examining lab reports which suggest that Questcor's product does not include a highly purified form of Acthar as promoted by the company but a degraded form of the drug, the investor alleged. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (MNK), which has agreed to buy Questcor, is not properly evaluating the risks of Questcor's drug, Einhorn stated. Mallinckrodt "is setting itself up to be a very attractive short sale candidate if the merger is completed," Einhorn believes. PRICE ACTION: In early afternoon trading, Lam Research lost 1.5% to $69, Rite Aid slid 3.5% to $7, Questcor lost 2% to $95, and Mallinckrodt dropped 3% to $74.50. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Destination Maternity withdraws proposal to combine with Mothercare
Destination Maternity announces that it does not intend to make an offer for Mothercare plc and is withdrawing its proposal for a possible combination with Mothercare. On July 2, Destination Maternity made an announcement confirming its interest in a possible combination with Mothercare and confirming its submission of two non-binding written proposals for a possible combination, both of which had been rejected by the Board of Directors of Mothercare. This announcement was required by the UK Takeover Code in light of press speculation at the time regarding Destination Maternity's interest in a possible combination with Mothercare. Following the July 2 announcement, Destination Maternity's financial adviser canvassed the views of shareholders who hold a substantial proportion of Mothercare shares. While Destination Maternity believes that its proposal was compelling, it is clear that the shareholders of Mothercare believe that only a very significant increase in the value of such proposal would be acceptable. In light of this and considering Destination Maternity has not been permitted by the Mothercare Board to conduct customary due diligence, Destination Maternity is unwilling to increase the value of its proposal and has therefore decided to withdraw its proposal. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	On The Fly: Midday Wrap
Stocks on Wall Street were lower at midday and on track to end a week marked by a torrent of earnings reports on a definite down note. Some high-profile disappointments weighed on the major averages, as Visa (V) and Amazon.com (AMZN) both fell significantly after their quarterly reports last night, dragging on the Dow and Nasdaq, respectively. The domestic economic calendar’s sole release of consequence, the durable goods orders report, came out before the open and was better than expected, but that did little to brighten the market's negative tone. ECONOMIC EVENTS: In the U.S., durable goods orders rebounded 0.7% in June after a 1.0% decline in the prior month, beating expectations for June increase of 0.5%. COMPANY NEWS: Shares of Amazon.com fell 10% after the e-commerce giant reported in-line second quarter revenue but a much higher than expected loss. A number of analysts responded to the news by downgrading the stock, while several others cut their price targets on the shares... Visa reported Q3 earnings per share and revenue that topped consensus forecasts, but its fiscal year EPS growth outlook was trimmed its fiscal year revenue growth view to be in the 9-10% range from its prior forecast for low double-digit constant revenue growth in the 10-11% range. Shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average component slid 4% following the report and guidance. MAJOR MOVERS: Among the notable gainers following their earnings reports were Datalink (DTLK), which jumped 17%, Mellanox (MLNX), which rose 13%, and VeriSign (VRSN), which gained 11%. Among the noteworthy losers was WellCare (WCG), which plunged 20% after the managed care company pre-announced significantly weaker than expected results. Also lower following their earnings reports were Swift Transport (SWFT), which fell nearly 15%, and Pandora (P), which dropped about 13%. INDEXES: Near midday, the Dow was down 131.61, or 0.77%, to 16,952.19, the Nasdaq was down 24.45, or 0.55%, to 4,447.66, and the S&P 500 was down 9.04, or 0.45%, to 1,978.94. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	WellCare profit warning sinks managed care names
A number of managed care names are falling after one of the companies in the sector, WellCare (WCG), preannounced significantly weaker than expected results. UBS, however, recommends using the weakness in the sector as a buying opportunity. WHAT'S NEW: WellCare, which specializes in managing Medicaid and Medicare plans, preannounced a second quarter per share loss of 7c, excluding certain items. Analysts on average expected the company to report a per share profit of 90c. The company's revenue came in slightly above expectations. WellCare cut its full-year earnings per share guidance to $2.20-$2.50 from $4.40-$4.75. The company said recipients of a new Medicaid program in Florida utilized more medical services than expected since the company began administering the program in May. Additionally, the company took an impairment charge related to an acquisition and it had an unfavorable reserve development. ANALYST REACTION: The factors cited by WellCare for the cut in its guidance appear to be specific to that company, UBS analyst A.J. Rice wrote. Meanwhile, data from other companies that administer Medicaid plans indicate that the increased utilization costs in that state are also specific to WellCare, Rice contended. For example, Centene (CNC) reported Q2 results earlier this week and indicated that utilization trends for newly covered beneficiaries in Florida was largely in line with expectations, while UnitedHealth (UNH) said its Medicaid business had performed well last quarter, the analyst stated. Additionally, WellCare said that its higher than expected medical utilization costs had been caused primarily by drug costs that exceeded its forecast, Rice stated. Since drug costs tend to be known relatively quickly, United Health and Centene would have divulged any issues with drug costs in conjunction with their Q2 results, Rice said. The analyst recommended that investors buy Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI), United Health and WellPoint (WLP) on any weakness today. PRICE ACTION: In late morning trading, Aetna fell 1.5% to $83, Cigna lost 1% to $95.50, UnitedHealth lost 1% to $84.50, WellPoint slid 1.5% to $113.50 and Centene tumbled 7% to $74 while WellCare plunged 19% to $62. :theflyonthewall.com

The shares have underperformed the broader averages in the prior three months, rising 2.5%. On a longer-term basis, 1-year chart, the trend has already begun to turn bearish. Price is below the 10, 30, and 50-day moving averages. The $150 area, near where shares are currently trading, is an important support level. A break below $150 would confirm a shift in bearish trend from short to intermediate-term. On a disappointment support below $150 on an increasing scale of negative news would be at $148.49, $145.20, and $140.62. All of those potential downside targets are pivot lows on a closing basis. If the news surprises, next resistance up would be at the 10-day moving average at $152.63 - the 10-day moving average, $154.72 - the 30-day moving average, and $157.75. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Deckers Outdoor climbs higher after Q1 results, increased FY outlook
Shares of footwear company Deckers Outdoor (DECK) are climbing higher after the company reported first quarter earnings per share and revenue that exceeded analysts' consensus along with an increased FY15 EPS and revenue outlook. WHAT'S NEW: Deckers said its Q1 loss per share was $1.07, which was better than analysts' consensus of a $1.28 per share loss. Revenue for the quarter was $211.5M, exceeding analysts' consensus estimates of $192.01M. The company's direct-to-consumer comparable sales were up 10% in Q1 and UGG brand net sales for the quarter were up 22.8% to $123.3M. Teva brand net sales in Q1 were up 25.7% to $39.3M and its Sanuk brand net sales were up 19.6% to $36M. Deckers' Q1 combined net sales of the company's other brands increased 54.5% to $12.9M. Sales for the global retail store business increased 29.4% to $42M. Looking ahead, Deckers now expects fiscal year 2015 EPS to increase approximately 14.5% from previous guidance of up 13.5% and expects FY15 revenues to increase about 14%, up from the previous guidance of 13%. The consensus estimate for EPS and revenue are $4.69 and $1.8B, respectively. Deckers now expects FY15 UGG brand revenues to increase approximately 12% over the prior year from the previous guidance of 11% and predicts FY15 Teva brand revenues will increase approximately 11% over the prior year. The company expects FY15 Sanuk brand revenues to increase approximately 15% compared to the prior year. Combined FY15 net sales of the company's other brands are expected to be approximately $82M. The company's guidance assumes a gross profit margin of approximately 49%, an operating margin of approximately 13%. and an effective tax rate of about 29%. WHAT'S NOTABLE: The company expects second quarter EPS of approximately 98c against analysts' estimates of $1.13 and sees revenues for the quarter up about 18% from the year ago period against estimates of $441.17M. ANALYST REACTION: Jefferies analyst Randal Konlk upgraded Deckers to Buy from Hold after the firm said it has more conviction of the company's margin expansion potential in FY15. The analyst believes that the company's market undervaluing the sequential upward potential at the moment from new product reveals could contribute an incremental $150M-$250M in revenue over the next 1-2 years. The firm increased its price target for Deckers to $130 from $78. ISI Group, which raised its price target on shares to $105 from $95, believes Deckers investments are beginning to drive more consistent sales results and driving it into a lifestyle brand. Citigroup also raised its price target on Deckers, to $105 from $94, following the better than anticipated Q1 results and guidance. PRICE ACTION: During late-morning trading, shares of Deckers were up $5.60 or 6.57%, to $90.84.

theflyonthewall.com: 	Zillow, Trulia continue climb after takeover talks report seen as 'credible'
Shares of online real estate listing companies Zillow (Z) and Trulia (TRLA) are climbing for a second session in a row after Bloomberg reported yesterday that Zillow was negotiating to buy Trulia. WHAT'S NOTABLE: Zillow is in talks to acquire Trulia and a deal could be announced as soon as next week, Bloomberg reported yesterday afternoon, citing unnamed sources. The deal could value Trulia at up to $2B, the news service added. ANALYST REACTION: The Bloomberg story is "credible," as there is a "compelling" rationale for the companies to combine, Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote. Based on the valuation at which Priceline (PCLN) acquired OpenTable, Trulia would be acquired at about $63 per share, the analyst wrote. Trulia and Zillow together would be worth a combined total of about $10B, representing a 25% increase over yesterday's closing prices, Walmsley estimated. Consolidation in the online real estate ad space would be logical ,as it could result in the creation of a true marketplace, the analyst believes. Such a marketplace could charge prices several times above current levels and create significant revenue synergies, the analyst contended. Additionally, a merger between the companies would enable them to significantly cut their marketing expenses, according to Walmsley, who kept a $42 price target and Buy rating on Trulia and a $78 price target and Hold rating on Zillow. PRICE ACTION: In mid-morning trading, Trulia rose 2.5% to $55.10 and Zillow advanced 5% to $153.24. Trulia is up over 35% since yesterday's open, while Zillow has gained over 20%. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Citigroup unit LavaFlow to pay $5M in settlement with SEC
The Securities and Exchange Commission has charged a Citigroup business unit operating an alternative trading system with failing to protect the confidential trading data of its subscribers. New York-based LavaFlow Inc. has agreed to pay $5M to settle the SEC’s charges, including a $2.85M penalty that is the agency’s largest to date against an ATS. According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, LavaFlow allowed an affiliate operating a technology application known as a smart order router to access and use confidential information related to the non-displayed orders of LavaFlow’s ECN’s subscribers. While LavaFlow only allowed the affiliate to use the confidential trading data for order router customers who also were ECN subscribers, the firm did not obtain consent from its subscribers to use their confidential information in this way, nor did LavaFlow disclose the use in its regulatory filings with the SEC. In addition to the Regulation ATS violations, the SEC’s order finds that LavaFlow aided and abetted a violation by the same affiliate that operated the smart order router, Lava Trading Inc., which continued to provide broker-dealer services for several months after it deregistered in August 2008. :theflyonthewall.com

During the second quarter of 2013, the company identified and corrected the understatement of the PTO liability and assessed and concluded that the correction was not material, or $0.6M, net of tax, to the company’s consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 2013, respectively.

theflyonthewall.com: 	Amazon sinks after greater than expected losses, several downgrades
Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) are falling after the company reported in-line second quarter revenue but a much higher than expected loss. A number of analysts responded to the news by downgrading the stock, while several others cut their price targets on the shares. WHAT'S NEW: Amazon reported a Q2 per share loss of (27c), compared with analysts' consensus outlook for losses per share of (15c). The company provided third quarter revenue guidance of $19.7B-$21.5B, versus the consensus outlook of $20.8B. The e-commerce giant's operating margin came in at (0.1%), down from 0.7% during the previous quarter. Amazon noted that it had significantly cut prices on its cloud offerings and had launched many new initiatives. ANALYST REACTION: In notes to investors earlier today, CRT Capital downgraded Amazon.com to Fair Value from Buy, while B. Riley lowered its rating on the stock to Neutral from Buy and Raymond James downgraded the stock to Market Perform from Outperform. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth responded to the news by cutting his price target on the stock to $340 from $350. The company's operating income guidance indicates that its margins will decline significantly as it makes additional investments in several areas, the analyst believes. He predicted that the stock would drop in the near-term and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. Similarly, Citigroup cut its price target on the shares to $358 from $395. Amazon's Q3 margin guidance was worse than expected and the company's increased investments will make it difficult for the stock to outperform. The firm kept a Neutral rating on the shares. More upbeat on the stock was Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali, who wrote that Amazon's results were "generally good." The company's core retail North American business is continuing to improve significantly, Squali believes. Given this trend and the company's large global opportunity, its investments are justified, the analyst contended. He trimmed his price target on the shares to $400 from $425 but kept a Buy rating on the stock. PRICE ACTION: In early trading, Amazon fell 11.3% to $318.14. :theflyonthewall.com

Freeport-McMoRan announced that its Indonesian subsidiary PT Freeport Indonesia received approval from the Government of Indonesia to resume exports of copper concentrates. PT-FI will resume full operations immediately and concentrate exports are expected to commence in August 2014. PT-FI has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of Indonesia under which the Government and PT-FI have agreed to negotiate an amended Contract of Work, to be completed over the next six months, to address provisions related to the size of concession area, royalties and taxes, domestic processing and refining, divestment, local content, and continuation of operations post-2021. Effective with the signing of the MOU, PT-FI has agreed to pay export duties set forth in a new regulation issued in July, to provide a $115M assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development and to increase royalties to 4.0% for copper and 3.75% for gold from the current rates of 3.5% for copper and 1% for gold. On July 25, the Government revised its January regulations regarding export duties to incorporate reduced rates for copper concentrate exports for companies engaged in smelter development. The revised regulations provide for duties on copper concentrate exports during smelter development initially at 7.5%, declining to 5% when development progress exceeds 7.5% and 0% when development progress exceeds 30%. PT-FI and the Government will commence immediate negotiations for an amended COW that is expected to be completed within six months. No terms of the COW other than the duties, smelter bond and royalties described above will be changed until the completion of the amended COW. :theflyonthewall.com

The shares have underperformed peers and the broader averages over the prior three months, down over 3%. In the same interval shares have traded in a quite narrow range largely bound by $55 at the low and $60 at the high. As we have seen repeatedly now through this earnings season, narrow ranges are often precursors to stronger moves once the range is broken. On good news, the upper bound at $60 would be a relatively easy objective. Additional resistance levels above $60 which could become upside targets are at $62.08 and $63.35. On a disappointment a break below $55 would be expected, with price currently already close to that bound at $56.26. Support levels which could become additional downside objectives would be at $52.55, $50, and $47.04. There is a small short-base in the name which could increase downside reactions in the absence of buy-to-cover demand. :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Fed Policy Outlook: analysts don't expect any major revelations from the FOMC
Fed Policy Outlook: analysts don't expect any major revelations from the FOMC in next week's (July 29, 30) meeting. Another $10 B cut in QE purchases is pretty much a foregone conclusion, with the Fed expected to finish its buybacks in October with a $15 B reduction. And while there is likely to be a hot debate over the exit strategy and rate lift-off, Wednesday's policy statement won't give anything away in terms of explicit strategies or rate lift-off timing. Indeed, about the only material change in the statement relative to June's should be a slight upgrade to the economic outlook and labor market conditions, while the statement on inflation should reiterate prices are running below target but longer-term expectations have remained stable. The time is fast approaching, however, that the Fed will have to change the "considerable time" forward guidance, as well as update the markets on whether Treasury holdings will be allowed to expire, or be reinvested. Yellen's dovish nature and the general belief at the Fed that the stock of Treasuries in the portfolio is more important than flows suggest the former tactic may be employed. Analysts are still forecasting the first rate hike will take place in Q2. Many other Fedwatchers have been pushing up their forecasts from 2H. And given the improvement in the labor market, there is risk for a hike as early as the March 17, 18, 2015 meeting, especially as it includes a press conference. :theflyonthewall.com

Today's U.S. durables report revealed modest durable orders gains both with and without transportation, but with a smaller than expected transportation boost and modestly disappointing component data. Firmness in June orders for capital equipment accompanied weaker than expected shipments figures for both capital equipment and durable goods overall, with additional restraint in inventory growth. Analysts expect real Q2 GDP growth of 2.5% with a 6% (was 8%) growth pace for real equipment spending and a $49 (was $52) B inventory addition, following respective Q1 contraction rates of 2.9% and 2.8% with a $65.8 B Q1 inventory subtraction. Analysts expect June increases of 0.6% for factory inventories and 0.7% for total inventories, given today's 0.4% factory durable inventory rise. Analysts assume a 0.7% June factory orders rise with a 0.4% factory shipments increase, given an assumed 0.6% nondurables rise. Analysts saw a 0.1% June durable shipments rise that tracked both the 0.1% increase in the June factory hours-worked gauge and the 0.4% rise in the durable goods manufacturing component of the last industrial production report. :theflyonthewall.com

FEMSA reported Q2 consolidated total revenues increased 14.4% and income from operations grew 9.0% compared to the second quarter of 2013, reflecting growth at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio. On an organic basis total revenues and income from operations increased 7.3% and 5.5%, respectively. FEMSA CEO Carlos Salazar Lomelin said, "In light of a continued challenging environment for our businesses, particularly in Mexico, our results for the quarter were solid. At Coca-Cola FEMSA, Mexican volumes again contracted reflecting the adverse backdrop of the excise tax, as well as extremely wet weather that this year seems to have arrived ahead of schedule, yet we continued to successfully implement pricing and packaging strategies that drove revenues and partially offset the negative pressure, together with our continued emphasis on efficiency and cost containment, as well as a generally benign raw material environment. Beyond Mexico, we are also facing challenging operating conditions in certain markets, such as Brazil, while other operations like Colombia are delivering more encouraging growth. At FEMSA Comercio comparable sales for the quarter showed some improvement, but once we adjust for the calendar effects of Semana Santa the growth year-to-date is just above 2%, more or less in line with the trend from last year but below our long term expectations. The opening of new stores has been strong, but clearly the Mexican consumer remains under pressure as the much awaited recovery remains elusive." :theflyonthewall.com

theflyonthewall.com: 	Big decisions loom for the Fed
Big decisions loom for the Fed though in a quiet moment next week the decision to taper by another $10 B to $25 B in QE purchases is likely to be a tame one, while leaving rate guidance unchanged and confirming continued progress in the labor market, says WSJ Fedwatcher Hilsenrath in his Real Time Economics blog. But, he suggests that behind the scenes Yellen and co. will have to mull changes to the statement after purchases end in October, when references to the end of QE and the phrase "considerable time" will need to be revised. Decisions on when to let securities expire and roll off their balance sheet instead of reinvesting, along with how best to utilize the reverse repo will be needed. He also suggests Yellen could be pressured by a rising chorus of Fed hawks, who want to see rates hiked earlier than later. :theflyonthewall.com

China Commercial Credit said it has made progress toward recovering a significant portion of the $5.4M it paid in Q1 to lenders on behalf of 11 loan guarantee service customers who had borrowed funds from these lenders but defaulted on their loan repayments. After determining that the majority of these defaulting borrowers had subsequently acquired the capability of repaying these funds, CCCR recovered approximately $0.7M in cash from these borrowers and converted an additional $2.1M of their debt into one-year loan notes payable by the borrowers directly to the company. All funds reclaimed via the above measures will be applied to CCCR's total capital available for use on its microfinance lending and loan guarantee businesses. The company expects to announce that its second quarter payments to lenders on behalf of loan guarantee customers, although less than in the first quarter, will still amount to about $3.7M. Of this total, CCCR has thus far recovered $1.1M and converted an additional $1.6M of their debt into one-year loan notes payable by the borrowers directly to the company. :theflyonthewall.com

The CHMP opinion supports the use of Zydelig in combination with rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who have received at least one prior therapy or, as first-line treatment in CLL patients in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy and also as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with FL that is refractory to two prior lines of treatment. The CHMP’s recommendation will now be reviewed by the European Commission, which has the authority to approve medicines for use in the 28 countries of the European Union. The CHMP positive opinion for Zydelig is based on data from two clinical trials – Study 116 and Study 101-09. Study 116, a pivotal Phase 3 trial, investigated the efficacy and safety of Zydelig in combination with rituximab in patients with previously treated CLL. The Phase 2 101-09 study assessed the efficacy and safety of Zydelig in patients with iNHL who are refractory to rituximab and alkylating agents.

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, at its July meeting, recommended granting marketing authorizations for two new medicines with novel mechanisms of action for the treatment of different forms of rare cancers of the blood. Imbruvica and Zydelig are recommended for authorization in the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have received at least one prior treatment, as well as a first-line treatment for patients with a specific genetic mutation that makes them unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. Imbruvica, an orphan medicine, is also recommended for use in the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back after previous treatments or is not responding to other treatments. Zydelig is also to be used for adult patients with follicular lymphoma that has not responded to two previous treatments. The CHMP opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for the adoption of a decision on EU-wide marketing authorizations. Once marketing authorisations have been granted, decisions about price and reimbursement will then take place at the level of each Member State considering the potential role/use of these medicines in the context of the national health system of that country. The marketing-authorization applicant for Imbruvica is Janssen-Cilag International (JNJ) and the marketing-authorization applicant for Zydelig is Gilead Sciences (GILD). :theflyonthewall.com

The Company estimates that annual operating profit associated with this growing revenue stream will incrcase approximately $5 million to $8 million in 2015, before transitional impacts, with accretive benefits that will scale over time. The company will incur transition costs in implementing the all-direct product distribution approach in the US.

The company also expects to incur approximately $10 million to $12 million in non-recurring expenses in the second half of 2014 associated with project management and other one-time costs required to implement the new model. Combined, the company estimates these transition costs will reduce reported EPS by approximately 23c-24c in 2014. The company estimates that the drawdown of this inventory will occur primarily in the first quarter of 2015 and will result in a one-time reduction in projected revenue and operating profit of $30 million to $35 million, and $23 million to $27 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company expects to incur $2 million to $3 million in remaining project management expenses in early 2015. :theflyonthewall.com

Magnum Hunter announced that it closed on the purchase of approximately 1,700 net mineral acres located in Monroe County, Ohio and Wetzel County, West Virginia for approximately $22.7M from the Ormet Corporation, et al. This acquisition will increase the company's net revenue interest on its existing 875 acre oil and gas lease located on the related acreage from approximately 86% to nearly 100% in the Marcellus Shale formation only. Under the same agreement, the company has also acquired an approximate 100% net revenue interest in the balance of the mineral rights to this acreage which will also include the Utica Shale formation. The company has previously drilled three Marcellus Shale wells on the existing oil and gas lease which have been producing rich natural gas and condensate since May 6. This mineral interest acquisition adds to the company's large drilling inventory of potential Marcellus and Utica Shale wells in these two counties of West Virginia and Ohio. The company is already drilling the vertical section of the first dry gas Utica Shale well on the Ormet 15 Pad. This well is expected to have an approximate lateral length of 4,800 feet with an anticipated 20+ stages of fracture stimulation treatment. The current development plan includes a total of 4 gross Utica Shale wells to be drilled, completed, and producing on this property by year-end 2014.

AngloGold stated, shareholders are referred to today's announcement by Rand Refinery regarding a loan facility extended to it by certain of its shareholders, as a precautionary measure. This follows challenges encountered in the implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning system at the refinery. AngloGold Ashanti confirms its participation in the loan facility. AngloGold Ashanti owns a 42.41% stake in the Rand Refinery and accounts for it using the equity accounting method as an associate. AngloGold Ashanti expects to make a provision in its accounts for $51M, which will impact second quarter earnings scheduled for release on August 11. In addition, AngloGold Ashanti notes that costs incurred in the previously announced closure of the Yatela mine in Mali, and ongoing restructuring at its Obuasi mine in Ghana, will also impact earnings for Q2. Over the past 18 months, AngloGold Ashanti has taken decisive steps to adapt to the sharp decline in the gold price by reducing costs and improving the overall quality of its portfolio to improve cash flow and returns. Part of that strategy is the closure of its Yatela mine in Mali and implementation of a range of interventions to address historic underperformance of the Obuasi mine in Ghana. :theflyonthewall.com

This revised guidance is consistent with our EPS profile in recent years whereby approximately 45% of annual EPS typically falls within the first half of the year. We have strong conviction that our 2014 free cash flow will be at least $675 million inclusive of approximately $250 million of one-time payments primarily relating to 2013 restructuring actions... We also remain committed to our capital allocation plan of returning up to $1 billion of capital to shareholders through 2015 as well as a strong and growing dividend.

Keryx Biopharmaceuticals announced the publication of results from the long-term, randomized, active control phase 3 study of Zerenex, the company's investigational oral ferric iron-based phosphate binder, for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. The PERFECTED study was published online today in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Data demonstrated the drug candidate's potential to become the first phosphate binder to increase iron stores while reducing the need for IV iron and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, according to the company. Zerenex met the study's primary end-point demonstrating a highly statistically significant change in serum phosphorus versus placebo over the four-week Placebo Control Period. Using a sequential gatekeeping strategy for the key pre-defined secondary end-points, Zerenex also demonstrated statistically significant increases in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, and significant reductions in the use of IV iron and ESAs, versus an active control of Renvela and/or Phoslo over the 52-week Active Control Period of the study. In addition, mean hemoglobin levels were higher in subjects treated with Zerenex as compared to subjects treated with active control. Shares of Keryx are up 3% in after hours trading. :theflyonthewall.com

Gentiva Health Services (GTIV) announced that it has entered into a nondisclosure agreement with the recognized owner, operator and investor who, as disclosed previously, delivered on July 17 a proposal to Gentiva’s board to acquire all outstanding shares of Gentiva common stock for $17.25 per share in cash, subject to certain conditions. As previously disclosed, the board also has received a conditional proposal from Kindred Healthcare (KND). The board intends to provide to Kindred a nondisclosure agreement substantially similar in all material respects to the agreement it entered into with the other party. If and when Kindred executes such nondisclosure agreement, the board will provide Kindred with the same level of due diligence that will be made available to the other party. Kindred’s access to due diligence will be further conditioned on the termination of its partial tender offer for 14.9% of Gentiva’s shares.

theflyonthewall.com: 	On The Fly: Closing Wrap
Stocks on Wall Street began the session slightly higher but were unable to gather any upside momentum during the day. The market barely reacted to the much better than expected weekly jobless claims data, as the Labor Department explained that this time of the year is typically volatile for the data. The new home sales report for June had the opposite effect, as sales were worse than expected and the previous month was also revised down. The number put a lid on the averages, which moved throughout the afternoon as if summer doldrums had set in. ECONOMIC EVENTS: In the U.S., initial jobless claims dropped 19K to 284K in the week ended July 19. While the BLS said there were no special factors in the claims data, they also reminded that the numbers can be very volatile at this time of year due in part to auto shutdowns. Markit's flash U.S. PMI for July dipped 1 point to 56.3 from 57.3 in June. June new home sales fell 8.1% to a 406K rate, which was worse than expected, and May's data was downwardly revised. In China, HSBC's flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52 in July from 50.7 a month earlier. COMPANY NEWS: Facebook (FB) achieved a new all-time high during the session and closed up $3.69, or 5.18%, to $74.98 after its revenue and profits beat expectations. After the report a number of Wall Street analysts hiked their price targets on the stock, with Jefferies and Topeka both raising their targets on the social network operator's stock to $100... Shares of General Motors (GM) declined $1.67, or 4.46%, to $35.74 after its earnings per share, excluding special items, missed consensus expectations and its revenue also fell short of the analysts' forecast. The company took a $400M special charge related to its ignition switch compensation program, but cautioned that there is no cap on this program and it is possible the total cost could increase by another $200M. Also, GM recorded a non-cash pre-tax special charge of about $900M in the second quarter for the estimated costs of future possible recalls for "up to the next 10 years on 30M GM vehicles on the road today." MAJOR MOVERS: Among the notable gainers was Trulia (TRLA), which surged $13.16, or 32.43%, to $53.74 after Bloomberg said the company is in talks to be acquired by rival real estate website operator Zillow (Z). Zillow shares also gained $19.29, or 15.25%, to $145.76 after the news service said it could tie-up with its peer in a deal that could value Trulia as much as $2B. Also higher was SodaStream (SODA), which jumped $2.73, or 9.45%, to $31.63 after Bloomberg said the home soda machine maker is holding talks with an investment firm about taking itself private at a valuation of about $828M, or $40 per share. However, an analyst at Stifel called that scenario "highly improbable to impossible." Among the noteworthy losers was Angie's List (ANGI), which plunged $1.96, or 19.27%, to $8.21 after reporting second quarter results that were worse than expected, prompting at least seven downgrades of its stock by Wall Street analysts. Also lower were Life Time Fitness (LTM), which lowered its FY14 earnings view and fell $6.00, or 12.7%, to $41.26 and D.R. Horton (DHI), which dropped $2.86, or 11.53%, to $21.94 after its quarterly profits missed expectations. INDEXES: The Dow slipped 2.83, or 0.02%, to 17,083.80, the Nasdaq dropped 1.59, or 0.04%, to 4,472.11, and the S&P 500 gained 0.97, or 0.05%, to 1,987.98. :theflyonthewall.com

Reports Q2 revenue $232M, consensus $247.93M. Callaway said, "The company had previously provided guidance that its sales and earnings would show a decrease versus the second quarter of 2013 as a result of a late start to the 2014 golf season, high retail inventory industrywide, and anticipated promotional activity during the second quarter. The company's second quarter results reflect those market conditions with sales being down 7%, slightly more than the company's prior guidance of flat to down 5%, and with earnings declining to 4c per diluted share compared to 12c per diluted share in 2013, which was slightly better than the company's prior guidance of breakeven to slightly profitable." :theflyonthewall.com

Latin America revenue growth was driven by strong sales of advanced solutions in Brazil and strength in tablets in Mexico. Strong revenue growth in North America, Europe and Latin America was partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific driven primarily by lower handset sales in Indonesia and continued sales weakness in China related to lower sales of tablets and softer demand for some of the products and vendors the company carries. Gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin grew respectively by 3 and 2 basis points year-over-year, benefiting from a better overall mix of higher value business, which more than offset lower margin volume growth in consumer and retail markets in Europe and new mobility distribution wins in North America. :theflyonthewall.com

SF3B1 is believed to play a critical role in the prognosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, a group of hematological cancers in which bone marrow does not produce enough healthy blood cells. Mutations of this gene indicate a more favorable disease progression for patients than the "wild-type" gene, so testing for these gene variants could potentially provide important guidance for treatment based on a personalized healthcare approach to MDS, according to the company.
