[b][11-sep-2008] Version 3.9.0[/b]
Yes, yes, I know it took some time to make a new version of the Universal ScreenMate, but I finally made it

Here's what's new since last version: 
 + added: 2 new characters: a robot that looks a little like wall-e, and a Blob thing with 5 custom animations
 + changed: the editor and screenmate supports now PNG images - thus you can create semitransparent characters or anything your imagination might cook up
 + improved: the editor! I hope I made it more user friendly - it now has lots of text to guide you
 + fixed: bugs of all sorts

Hope you enjoy i; Feel free to comment :)
P.S. Many thanks go to james3mg for long long lists of suggestions/wishes and bugs

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for the replies (especially to james3mg).
Secondly... well, the new version of Mario Screenmate is out there. Most probably the next version will be renamed into "Universal Screenmate"
The best thing I added this time is the Character editor. With this anyone ca make skins/characters, translate their quotes into anylanguage and many other...
I also released the source of SuperMarioScreenmate v3.6; for those interested check the attachment. ...and yes, I am planning to release sources for the editor, but only after I launch the next version (same for the screenmate) 
P.S. This version si beta momentarly. In a week or so I'll fix all the bugs and glitches and write a help file. Anyone is invited to make characters, and with your approval I will include them into the next release.
Cheers,
  Adrian

[b][old] Version 'too old to remember'[/b]
Hello! Do you think anyone would keep a Mario as a screenmate on his/her desktop??? and it's not only a screenmate.
Here's what it can do:
+ jump, run, walk, throw fireballs at the mouse causing it to go away, chase he mouse or say things... (only on the screen)
+ his behaviour varyes due to his mood; he can be walky, angry, sleepy or talky :)
You can set him to remind you of something, make him go away, get the color underneath your mouse pointer (like #FF0000), set him to automatically shutdown your computer or search on the net using Google, YouTube or Wikipedia
