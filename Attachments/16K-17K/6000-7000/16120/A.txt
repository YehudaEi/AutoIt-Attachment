All the charisma of a 
All the charm of a 
All the elegance of a 
All the finesse of a 
Are you really a 
Are you related to a 
As likeable as a 
As much fun to be with as a 
As welcome as a 
Basically, you are a 
Be gone, you 
Brains of a 
Buzz-off, you 
Can't you be less of a 
Did you have to try hard to become a 
Did you learn manners from a 
Do you enjoy being a 
Do you take pleasure in being a 
Don't ever come back, you 
Don't give me that, you 
Don't take this the wrong way but you're a 
Don't they shoot people like you, you 
Drop dead, you 
Even your best friend calls you a 
Get lost, you 
Get out of my sight, you 
How come you're such a 
How did I find such a 
How did you get to be such a 
I assume you are trying to be a 
I can finally say that I've met a 
I can tell that you are a 
I hate to be critical, but you're a 
I just know you're a 
I know your sort, you 
I would describe you as a 
I'd prefer the company of a 
I'd rate you slightly lower than a 
I'd rather spend time with a 
I'd rather trust a 
I'll be diplomatic and only call you a 
I'm looking at a 
Inferior to a 
It would be a kindness to call you a 
It's an understatement to say that you're a 
It's not my fault you're a 
I've had more fun with a 
I've never seen a worse example of a 
Keep your distance, you 
Let me compare thee to a 
Never before have I met such a 
Run along now, you 
Shove off, you 
Shut up, you 
Sod off, you 
Take heed, you 
The charm and personality of a 
The last thing I need is another 
The truth is, you're just a 
There's no cure for being a 
There's nothing I hate more than a 
There's nothing worse than a 
Thou art a 
To me, you resemble a 
To put if kindly, you are a 
To put it mildly, you're a 
Up yours, you 
Was your mother a 
Watch it, you 
Well, aren't you just a 
Were you conceived by a 
Were you descended from a 
Were you raised by a 
Were you spawned from a 
Were you the illegitimate offspring of a 
What are you looking at you 
What colour is the sky in your world, you 
What did you just call me, you 
What made you such a 
When all is said and done, youre a 
Where did you learn to be such a 
Who asked you to butt in you 
Who asked your opinion you 
Who taught you to be such a 
Why am I wasting my time with a 
Will I ever find a bigger example of a 
You 
You are a 
You are a fine example of a 
You are best summed up as a 
You are far worse than a 
You are inferior to a 
You are the living definition of a 
You are the world's worst example of a 
You are what we in the trade refer to as a 
You are worryingly similar to a 
You can't help being a 
You carry on like a 
You come across as a 
You compare unfavourably with a 
You couldn't hold a candle to a 
You couldn't outwit a 
You do a good impression of a 
You don't even qualify as a 
You have all the desirability of a 
You have all the dynamism of a 
You have been found guilty of being a 
You have degenerated into a 
You have my pity, you 
You have the brains of a 
You have the deneamour of a 
You have the manners of a 
You have the social skills of a 
You look like a 
You poor excuse for a 
You rank infinitely lower than a 
You remind me of a 
You smell like a 
You son of a 
You were spawned from a 
You would even offend a 
You wouldn't match up to a 
You'd be rejected by a 
You'd have to improve to become a 
You'd have to progress to become a 
Your mother was a 
You're about as engaging as a 
You're about as entertaining as a 
You're indistinguishable from a 
You're just another 
You're such a 
You're the spitting image of a 
You're worse than a 
May I compare thee to a
